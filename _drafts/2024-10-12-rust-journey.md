Rust - Log 1

Signed integer: can be represented both positive and negative integer
Unsigned integer: always positive integer

length      signed      Unsigned

8bit        i8          u8

16 bit      i16         u16

32 bit      i32         u32

64 bit      i64         u64

128 bit     i128        u128

arch        isize       usize

arch stands for architecture --> size depends on computer's architecture
example: today's pcs are 64 bit architecture --> isize = i64; usize = usize 

Default type integer: i32 
Default type float: f64
